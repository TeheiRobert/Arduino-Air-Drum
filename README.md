# Arduino-Air-Drum

This is a school project, the code may be full of bugs.

The sensors are connected to arduino using I2C protocol and each one is straped to a wooden spoon. The pedal for snare is read using a digital pin.

The project contains a Processing app which looks like this ![Alt text](http://i.imgur.com/bOxbS46.pnge "Processing")

Using serial communication we send commands to a Processing app which interprets those commands such that the left "drum" is used to play notes for the left lane, same for the "right" drum and the pedal plays notes for the middle lane.
